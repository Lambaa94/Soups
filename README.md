## Description

Really enjoyed creating this project and learning all about the *Model-View-Controller*. I found this to be very enjoyable cause it allowed me to organize my code so it is not just a big hunk of information. Learning how an *ORM* works was very interesting and I know how a firm understanding on how the different parts of a *MVC* work together and has a more organized path. I came across the issue with making sure my syntax was exactly correct and I am noticing that coding as a whole is not so forgiving when it comes to even the slightest of errors. Doing this more and more is helping me understand all of the little bits and pieces to notice so that next time when I am working on something similar I dont make that mistake again. 

What this application does is you can input information into a database, update the information by changing the information from false to true and then deleting the info from the database. I chose the to make it about soup because let's face it, it's one of the best foods out there!
